#4.6 - Lab: Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA, and KNN

##4.6.1 - The Stock Market Data
Today: The current percentage return for current day
Lags(1-5): Previous percentages of past days. 5 being 5 days ago
```{r}
library(ISLR)
names(Smarket)
dim(Smarket)
summary(Smarket)
```
Removing the 9th row
```{r}
cor(Smarket[,-9])
```
Year and volume have the highest correlation
```{r}
attach(Smarket)
plot(Volume)
```
##4.6.2 - Logistic Regression
Use glm fit w/ Lag1-Lag5 and Volume
```{r}
glm.fit=glm(Direction~Lag1+Lag2+Lag3+Lag4+Lag5+Volume, data=Smarket, family=binomial)
summary(glm.fit)
```
```{r}
coef(glm.fit)
summary(glm.fit)$coef
```
Looking at the 'Pr(>|z|)' column
```{r}
summary(glm.fit)$coef[,4]
```
```{r}
glm.probs = predict(glm.fit, type="response")
glm.probs[1:10]
```
Verifying R input dummy variables
```{r}
contrasts(Direction)
```
Make 1250 items vector down. Populate those with > .5 to "Up"
```{r}
glm.pred=rep("Down", 1250)
glm.pred[glm.probs > 0.5] = "Up"
```

```{r}
table(glm.pred, Direction)
mean(glm.pred==Direction)
```
Down down and up up are the correct answers
###Split to train and test
```{r}
train=(Year<2005)
Smarket.2005=Smarket[!train,]
dim(Smarket.2005)
Direction.2005=Direction[!train]
```
